# Hotel Management System (Python)

## Project Overview
The concept behind this Hotel Management System is a console application developed 
with Python programming language for hotel management and how hotel staff can 
manage hotel room records; view room bookings and track performance of hotel systems.

With the help of a user-friendly menu system and data being stored on the filesystem, this 
application allows hotel employees to create new, edit and delete existing records 
related to each room, view hotel's current organised occupancy and room income reportings, 
and deliver a monthly report containing total earnings to date.

## Main Features
- Ability to access all available room records (able to add, update, or delete)
- Ability to access the current occupancy and associated data such as number of rooms occupied by each guest
- Calculate monthly hotel income
- Deliver various reports of the hotel's performance (day and month)
- Data is stored on the filesystem as a text document

## Used Technology
- Python programming language
- Text file data storage
- Console User Interface

## Post Learning Experiences
- Increased understanding of how to program in Python as well as develop a logical flow
- Working knowledge of file manipulation and how to manage large datasets
- Developed an understanding of how to design a menu-driven management application
- Developed greater problem solving and debugging capabilities
